# Scare-Factor

I made this landing page for an escape room in under 8 hours.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

For this project I wanted to be as creative as possible within a time limit. I gave myself a loose 6 hours to design and launch a landing page. While it took a bit longer to completely launch, I was able to have a successful web page in a short window. I used mostly CSS for the transformatons and structure of the page. At the end there was a canvas effect I use Javascript for, however it's only able to be seen on computer, not mobile.

## Lessons Learned:
This was a great challenge for myself. I love trying to make something within a scope. Finishing a project important to me and where a lot of the fun comes from, soit all becomes a puzzle to get the best product in the timeframe. I learned some new CSS tricks and was actually able to put canvas in a page. I think for next time for a landing page I will try to go even simpler, I think some whitespace can look good without looking plain. Overall I would do another time challenge again.
